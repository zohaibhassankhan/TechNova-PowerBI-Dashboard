# TechNova Financial Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

### Overview
The TechNova Financial Analytics Dashboard is a multi-page Power BI report designed to deliver clear, modern, and executive-ready financial insights. It includes year-over-year performance metrics, revenue and expense analytics, forecasting logic, and customer/membership breakdowns — all presented in a clean dark-theme layout.

This project demonstrates end-to-end BI skills: data modeling, DAX, Power Query transformations, UI/UX design, and storytelling through analytics.
